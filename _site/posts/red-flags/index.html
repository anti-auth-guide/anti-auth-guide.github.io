  <h1>Authoritarian Red Flags</h1>
  <p>Here are some things to watch out for that dictators/authoritarians like to do. Some things on this list have already happened, and some had not (yet) happened at the time this site went live – but maybe they have now that you’re reading this.</p>
<p>We started this list just a few days after Trump took power, and not gonna lie we didn’t think so many of these would have already happened by the time we published this.</p>
<br />
<h3>Hollowing out institutions and centralizing power</h3>
<p>As alternative centers of power, institutions are the dictator’s enemy. Institutions have established rules, ethics, and standards that are independent of the dictator’s whims. (For more on why bureaucracies can actually be good, we recommend Michael Lewis’s <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/311900/the-fifth-risk-by-lewis-michael/9780141991429">The Fifth Risk</a>.)<br>
If you want to hollow out institutions, you might:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Replace career professionals and experts, whose loyalty is to the job and to the country, with people who are loyal only to you</strong>. This is especially important to do in spaces that have historically been non-politicized and that require non-partisanship, like organizations that, say, try to keep people alive by getting them vaccinated. Personal loyalty to the leader(s) becomes the most important, and sometimes only, criterion for high-level positions.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where have we seen this before?</em> Among many illustrious examples, Vladimir Putin gave his <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-decree-promotes-ally-dyumin-russias-security-council-2024-09-30/">former bodyguard</a> a high-level role in Russia’s government in 2024.</li>
<li><em>Where are we seeing it in the US?</em> So. Many. Places. But making <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-patel-fbi-justice-department-518329110ea230e2989095bfcbe34c59">Kash Patel, a total lightweight bootlicker, in charge of the FBI</a>, is a decent place to start.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Starve agencies of funding, staff, and other resources</strong>. They can’t do their jobs if they’re out of cash. Maybe you don’t like what those institutions do. Maybe you don’t even know what they do. No matter, screw ‘em!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where have we seen this before?</em> Gonna be honest, we don’t have a great international example for this, because we’re just some random people and we don’t know everything. But we still thought it was important to include!</li>
<li><em>Where are we seeing it in the US?</em> Again, dear lord, too many examples to count. But <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5310673/usaid-trump-administration-global-health">USAID is a big one</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enable corruption and personal enrichment</strong>. What good is running a country if you’re not using it to make some $crilla for you and your boys? One easy way to do this is to get rid of any institution that might prevent you from using the country as your personal piggybank, or from stealing average Americans’ money. It is, in fact, the redistribution of wealth, only it redistributes from the poor and middle-class up to the rich. Yay!</p>
<ul>
<li>Where have we seen this before? <a href="https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-rise-of-kleptocracy-power-and-plunder-in-putins-russia/">“In Vladimir Putin’s Russia, opaque financial flows and an equally murky network of ex-KGB officers ... come together in a distinctive system of corruption.”</a></li>
<li><em>Where are we seeing it in the US?</em> Well, <a href="https://archive.is/6CDGC">gutting consumer protections</a> does really help the Tech-Bro-in-Chief do whatever he wants with his businesses, conflicts of interest be damned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ignore the courts</strong>. Most courts do not have their own armies. Which means they can tell you to stop doing something but they can’t <em>make</em> you stop doing it. Bet they wish they had thought of that army thing earlier!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where have we seen this before?</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/top-hungarian-lawyer-accuses-pm-orban-of-harming-rule-of-law-idUSKBN1ZK1Y8/">Viktor Orban ignored court orders requiring payouts of state funds.</a></li>
<li><em>Where are we seeing it in the US?</em>
<ul>
<li>For this one, we originally wrote: “We haven’t really seen it yet, though we’ve come close a bunch of times, and Musk loves tweeting that judges should have no power. But this will be one of the most alarming possible signs of a descent into authoritarianism. Given that every Republican in Congress seems to be enjoying a good long nap right now, the judicial branch is the only other center of power with the constitutional right to check Trump. If Trump decides to ignore them, that is a very scary sign that we are now completely outside the rule of law system.”</li>
<li>Since then, it’s unfortunately happened: <a href="https://archive.is/q8QcM">the Trump administration went ahead and deported more than 200 Venezuelans despite a judge ordering them to halt the deportations</a>. This is bad.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h3>Hyping up the fanboys</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Create people for your followers to hate.</strong> Enemies at home! Enemies abroad! Your followers need to know that the woke deep-state transgender globalists, with all their fancy degrees, are colluding with the European Union to force everyone to get DEI surgery!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where have we seen this before?</em> Russian propaganda looooooves talking trash about “<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/putin-claims-real-war-being-waged-against-russia/a-65557289">globalist elites</a>.” And about “<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/02/15/russia-first-convictions-under-lgbt-extremist-ruling">extremist</a>” LGBT activists. And about lots of other paranoid stuff.</li>
<li><em>Where are we seeing it in the US?</em> Hooboy. Do we really have to give you a link for this one?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encourage violence against the haters!</strong> Physical, psychological, all kinds of violence will do. You just want your haters scared, and all the better if you don’t personally have to get your hands dirty doing it. Remember, trauma = good times!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where have we seen this before?</em> During the Cultural Revolution in China, Mao whipped Red Guards into a frenzy, letting them terrorize people throughout the country, <a href="https://archive.is/nmg7i">sometimes even beating them to death</a>.</li>
<li><em>Where are we seeing it in the US?</em> Super fun-time guy Russ Vought, now in charge of the government’s budget and management office, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/10/who-is-russell-vought-trump-office-of-management-and-budget">said in October 2024</a> that “We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected . . . When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.” That said, we should be on the alert for increased physical violence against the administration’s “enemies.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use ambiguity as a sword and shield</strong>. Your fanboys LOVE it when you say or do something fascist, and all the lame normies totally buy it when you tell them it was just a joke! Anyone who doesn’t think it’s a joke is trying to get you canceled! But actually you meant it anyway haha</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where have we seen this before?</em> The precursor of this phenomenon is the dog whistle: using coded language to appeal to your followers while maintaining deniability. And the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/26/990274685/how-extremists-weaponize-irony-to-spread-hate">alt-right in America</a> has been known to use irony to attract new followers while maintaining deniability for many years now.</li>
<li><em>Where are we seeing it in the US?</em>  Both Steve Bannon and Elon Musk pretending that the very clear Nazi salutes they made, were, in fact, just a “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2glydm3gmo">wave</a>” or a non-event hyped up in a “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy48v1x4dv4o">sooo tired</a>” attack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h3>Enforcing ideology through propaganda and censorship</h3>
<p>This is a war on the objective truth. People under the Emperor have to repeat his lies, otherwise they’ll be considered disloyal.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Attack the media and bring it under your control when you can</strong>.This is a bigly important step. There’s a lot to admire in the Chinese Communist Party here, which understands the value in getting people to shut up. Some of its tried and true techniques, which we’re now seeing in the US, include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.chinafile.com/library/nyrb-china-archive/china-anaconda-chandelier">Make people afraid to publish on certain topics, resulting in individual and institutional self-censorship</a>. In the US, world’s richest coward Jeff Bezos <a href="https://archive.is/oeLHP">decided that his opinion columnists could no longer have opinions</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/article/china-anti-journalist-and-fake-news-campaign-to-continue-in-2023">Punish</a> or <a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/uighur-xinjiang.php">limit</a> media organizations that print what you don’t want them to and give preferential treatment to the ones that do. In the US, Trump kicked the Associated Press out of White House briefings for <a href="https://archive.is/uFOav">refusing to use the frankly embarrassing term “Gulf of America”</a> and offered up a briefing spot to <a href="https://archive.is/NolsV">fact-lite scream factory Newsmax instead</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/our-research/how-does-chinese-government-manage-social-media-case-weibo">Gain effective control over private social media</a>. In the US, this has allowed Elon to turn X into a “<a href="https://archive.is/3AUaP">pro-Trump echo chamber</a>.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/foreign-journalists-china-intimidation-survey">Physically attack journalists</a>. We haven’t seen the government (or government-hired thugs) do this yet, but we have seen <a href="https://archive.is/E0ipm">individual nutjobs do it</a>.</li>
<li>Give <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/chinese-government-censors-ruling-lines-through-australian-books-20190222-p50zpn.html">lists of banned words</a> and <a href="https://archive.is/hWgei">topics</a> to publishers – This hasn’t happened quite so explicitly yet. (Lots of self-censorship is already happening. We know this first hand because some of our employers have been doing this.) But we should be on the lookout for the government to start doing it directly..</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.is/nJPX0">Give outlets propaganda talking points to parrot</a>. – Ditto.</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.is/dfsr6">Harass journalists so much that they quit</a>. – Ditto.</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.is/XDY3P">Arrest and prosecute journalists</a>. – Ditto. (The Cheeto-in-Chief has sure been making lots of threats though, so we fully expect them to test the waters at some point soon.)</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.is/geLtQ">Shut down independent news outlets</a>. – Ditto.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extol and try to impose “traditional values.”</strong> Remember when men were men and women weren’t . . . much of anything? And white people could walk around doing whatever they wanted without anyone making them feel even a tiny bit self-conscious about it? That was super awesome for everyone, as long as everyone was a white guy. Why don’t we do that again?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where have we seen this before?</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250124084705/https://theconversation.com/kremlin-promotes-traditional-values-but-leaves-some-battles-to-the-governors-246396">Russia</a> has been casting itself as the defender of “traditional values”, to give just one of many examples.</li>
<li><em>Where are we seeing it in the US?</em>  “<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-trump-appointee-said-200100703.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJtANwvWqQFxqPojc_GzAMCmbiJKTlGTwiRVZg9et_VxDSznD_fH9bn75qRETAmSk1WLSmPY2Jl3jaMySnhnjpoXYNL0d_c9Tr_mvjnqS2noTXdNWKi6VTRyuoPDwlsFuKzkd2CbFKCuV2z-SVvzC10BA4oA_9KqTVTY1GQ-AZRH">Competent white men</a>” taking the places of people with actual expertise. Leaders claiming to protect women, “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/donald-trump-women-protector-wisconsin-rally">whether the women like it or not</a>.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advance an anti-science, anti-expert agenda.</strong> You know who can call out your bs? Anyone who deals with hard data and/or the laws of physics. It would probably be bad if all their “facts” got in the way of your bloviating. Better make sure that no one believes them, just in case they do manage to get the word out . . .</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where have we seen this before?</em> In 1950s China, citizens were urged to kill sparrows (among other creatures) en masse to prevent them from eating grain. But, uh, turns out sparrows were <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0306422018800259">pretty important for keeping down the locust population</a>, and while the sparrow thing wasn’t the <em>only</em> reason for the famine that followed, it wasn’t <em>not</em> the reason…<br>

</ul>
<br/>
<ul>
<li><em>Where are we seeing it in the US?</em> RFK is a leading proponent of <a href="https://archive.is/Eqxeb">killing chickens</a> and <a href="https://archive.is/HCKcr">also your kids</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lie with confidence</strong>. Yes, yes, all politicians lie. But they don’t lie like YOU. You don’t care how obvious or pathetic your lies are. You’re not there to explain away a mistake or spin a gaffe. YOU ARE THERE TO INVENT YOUR OWN REALITY.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where have we seen this before?</em> This <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/05/a-list-of-hitlers-lies-compiled-by-the-office-of-war-information-in-1942.html">1942 list of Hitler’s biggest lies</a> contains some great examples.</li>
<li><em>Where are we seeing it in the US?</em> <a href="https://archive.is/Tk8Ej">All day</a>, <a href="https://archive.is/4NUXS">every day</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h3>Suppressing dissent</h3>
<p>Sure, there’s censorship, but there’s also lots of other ways to keep people from organizing against you.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Distract, distract, distract</strong>. Real hard for all those whiny libs to band together if they’re all whining about something different. Do everything, so your haters can do nothing!  Flood the zone, baby!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where have we seen this before?</em> There probably are examples of this elsewhere, but we don’t personally know of them.</li>
<li><em>Where are we seeing it in the US?</em> Flooding the zone <a href="https://archive.is/KT9eR">IS the key strategy of the second Trump administration</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Fix” problems so they’ll shut up</strong>. If the whiny libs DO manage to cause a ruckus, just tell them you’re fixing whatever it is they’re whining about. They’ll feel better and go away. Plus it’ll keep your pain-in-the-arse know-it-all bureaucrats busy with a bunch of bs paperwork. Problem solved!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where we’ve seen this before:</em> See above.</li>
<li><em>Where are we seeing it in the US?</em> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-usaid-emergency-waivers-arent-working-from-ebola-to-aids/">USAID waivers for Ebola and AIDS work, which were promised and which the Trump Administration insists exist but that people doing the work say are useless</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Start dividing people up into groups so you can better surveil, harass, and restrict them</strong>. How are you going to start hunting down all the “DEI” people if you don’t know where they are? Better get those details all written down somewhere so you can send in the goons when it’s time. Also, don’t forget to harass anyone that seems like they might be in the wrong group! (Someone look not-quite-white? Make them show their papers!) It’s important you keep them from getting too uppity.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where we’ve seen this before:</em> In the last decade, the Chinese government has put multiple ethnic groups (Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, among others) under <a href="https://www.hrw.org/video-photos/interactive/2019/05/02/china-how-mass-surveillance-works-xinjiang">extreme surveillance</a> and <a href="https://archive.is/anLsY">extra-legal detention</a>, including in <a href="https://archive.is/5sDFo">internment camps</a>. But a big part of this was making lots and lots of <a href="https://archive.is/sWsu5">lists and databases</a> to track everyone.</li>
<li><em>Where are we seeing it in the US?</em> <a href="https://archive.is/CeHxy">Missouri wants to make lists of anyone who could potentially, maybe, possibly think about having an abortion: “Maintain a central registry of each expectant mother who is at risk for seeking an abortion of her unborn child.”</a></li>
<li>Something to watch out for: particular groups of people suddenly being denied passports or the right to travel (like how in China <a href="https://www.afr.com/world/asia/china-demands-schoolteachers-hand-in-their-passports-20241007-p5kggo">school teachers have been asked to hand in their passports</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attack civil society</strong>. Those a**holes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Where we’ve seen this before:</em> Jailing peaceful protesters and artists, like the band <a href="https://archive.is/nIUpw">Pussy Riot in Russia</a>, or the activist <a href="https://archive.is/vLtqI">“Feminist Five” in China</a>. This also gives protesters criminal records, which can harm their future employment opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Where are we seeing it in the US?</em> During the George Floyd protests in 2020, the New York City police <a href="https://archive.is/UYKcV">deprived protesters</a> “of their first amendment rights through a ‘coordinated’ campaign of indiscriminate brutality and unlawful arrests.”</p>
<img src="/static/img/georgia.jpg" alt="georgia" title="georgia">
<em>Protesters in Georgia blasted by water canons while waving the EU flag.</em>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manufacture (or exploit) a disaster.</strong> This one’s an oldie but a goodie. People don’t complain as much when you restrict their rights right after some sort of catastrophe. But then you don’t have to give them those rights back! And you’ve taken away their right to even ask for them back! Classic.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where we’ve seen this before:</em> “<a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-reichstag-fire">On February 27, 1933, the German parliament (Reichstag) building burned down due to arson. The Nazi leadership and its German Nationalist coalition partners exploited the fire … They claimed that emergency legislation was needed … the resulting act “For the Protection of the People and State” abolished a number of constitutional protections and paved the way for Nazi dictatorship</a>.”</li>
<li><em>Where are we seeing it in the US?</em> They’re starting small with a bunch of random “<a href="https://archive.is/FhSkx">emergencies</a>” but be on the lookout for something much bigger. Project 2025 has suggested that Trump invoke the Insurrection Act.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attack your enemies with trumped-up (see what we did there?) or unrelated charges</strong>. Is some loudmouth really pissing you off but technically hasn’t done anything illegal? No problem, find some other reason to arrest them! No way your beautiful conservative judges are going to stop you.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where we’ve seen this before:</em> <a href="https://archive.is/I6imO">In 2022, Kazakhstan labeled protesters as “terrorists” so it could use anti-terrorist laws against them</a>.</li>
<li><em>Where are we seeing it in the US?</em> A Wisconsin judge was arrested &quot;<a href="https://archive.is/i00zW">allegedly for helping an undocumented man avoid abduction by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents outside her courtroom</a>.&quot; The merits of the case are almost beside the point–it’s clear the arrest was designed to intimidate other judges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Send out Interpol notices to catch political opponents who have fled abroad</strong>. See, there’s this “‘international police” organization that will arrest people for you. All you have to do is tell them that the people are very, very bad!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where we’ve seen this before:</em> <a href="https://safeguarddefenders.com/en/blog/repeat-offender-chinas-violations-interpol-rules-continue-benin-and-thailand">China</a> uses Interpol notices against political dissidents, trying to get other countries to arrest and ship them back home. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/interpol-policing-success-failures-60-minutes/">Russia</a> does it, too.</li>
<li>Will America join its new authoritarian friends in abusing Interpol notices? Probably.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h3>Enacting state-sponsored violence</h3>
<p>This is the part where things get truly ugly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>International aggression, or acting like a mafia state</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where have we seen this before?</em> Russia invading <a href="https://archive.is/ulkGM">Georgia</a>, <a href="https://archive.is/0442Q">Crimea</a>, and <a href="https://archive.is/KVAFC">Ukraine</a>.</li>
<li><em>Where are we seeing it in the US?</em> Trump is threatening to <a href="https://archive.is/CYz5Y">annex Greenland</a>, or take over the <a href="https://archive.is/Bc6ZY">Panama Canal</a>, or make <a href="https://archive.is/rBZEM">Canada the 51st state</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extra-legal detentions.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where have we seen this before?</em> <a href="https://archive.is/5sDFo">Internment camps in Xinjiang</a> (China).</li>
<li><em>Where are we seeing it in the US?</em> One extra-legal option (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/trump-guantanamo-bay-migrants">sending immigrants to Guantanamo</a>) already happened. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-deportations-gang-venezuela-0cf2c3a26d7f4bafa87ad6ca5a640313">Immigrants have also been illegally sent to El Salvadorian jails</a>. And <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/05/nx-s1-5287670/trump-el-salvador-americans-prison">Donald Trump has entertained the idea of sending prisoners who are US citizens to El Salvador</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mass prosecutions</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Where have we seen this before?</em> In 2024, Hong Kong <a href="https://archive.is/i3a0I">handed jail sentences to 45 people in a mass trial</a>. Their crime? Trying to exercise their rights in Hong Kong’s electoral system.</li>
<li><em>Where have we seen this in the U.S.?</em> Thankfully, nowhere yet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
