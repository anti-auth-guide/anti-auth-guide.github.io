		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here are some things to watch out for that dictators/authoritarians like to do. Some things on this list have already happened, and some had not (yet) happened at the time this site went live – but maybe they have now that you’re reading this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started this list just a few days after Trump took power, and not gonna lie we didn’t think so many of these would have already happened by the time we published this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hollowing out institutions and centralizing power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As alternative centers of power, institutions are the dictator’s enemy. Institutions have established rules, ethics, and standards that are independent of the dictator’s whims. (For more on why bureaucracies can actually be good, we recommend Michael Lewis’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/311900/the-fifth-risk-by-lewis-michael/9780141991429&quot;&gt;The Fifth Risk&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to hollow out institutions, you might:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replace career professionals and experts, whose loyalty is to the job and to the country, with people who are loyal only to you&lt;/strong&gt;. This is especially important to do in spaces that have historically been non-politicized and that require non-partisanship, like organizations that, say, try to keep people alive by getting them vaccinated. Personal loyalty to the leader(s) becomes the most important, and sometimes only, criterion for high-level positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where have we seen this before?&lt;/em&gt; Among many illustrious examples, Vladimir Putin gave his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-decree-promotes-ally-dyumin-russias-security-council-2024-09-30/&quot;&gt;former bodyguard&lt;/a&gt; a high-level role in Russia’s government in 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt; So. Many. Places. But making &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-patel-fbi-justice-department-518329110ea230e2989095bfcbe34c59&quot;&gt;Kash Patel, a total lightweight bootlicker, in charge of the FBI&lt;/a&gt;, is a decent place to start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starve agencies of funding, staff, and other resources&lt;/strong&gt;. They can’t do their jobs if they’re out of cash. Maybe you don’t like what those institutions do. Maybe you don’t even know what they do. No matter, screw ‘em!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where have we seen this before?&lt;/em&gt; Gonna be honest, we don’t have a great international example for this, because we’re just some random people and we don’t know everything. But we still thought it was important to include!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt; Again, dear lord, too many examples to count. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5310673/usaid-trump-administration-global-health&quot;&gt;USAID is a big one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enable corruption and personal enrichment&lt;/strong&gt;. What good is running a country if you’re not using it to make some $crilla for you and your boys? One easy way to do this is to get rid of any institution that might prevent you from using the country as your personal piggybank, or from stealing average Americans’ money. It is, in fact, the redistribution of wealth, only it redistributes from the poor and middle-class up to the rich. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where have we seen this before? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-rise-of-kleptocracy-power-and-plunder-in-putins-russia/&quot;&gt;“In Vladimir Putin’s Russia, opaque financial flows and an equally murky network of ex-KGB officers ... come together in a distinctive system of corruption.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt; Well, &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/6CDGC&quot;&gt;gutting consumer protections&lt;/a&gt; does really help the Tech-Bro-in-Chief do whatever he wants with his businesses, conflicts of interest be damned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignore the courts&lt;/strong&gt;. Most courts do not have their own armies. Which means they can tell you to stop doing something but they can’t &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; you stop doing it. Bet they wish they had thought of that army thing earlier!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where have we seen this before?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/world/top-hungarian-lawyer-accuses-pm-orban-of-harming-rule-of-law-idUSKBN1ZK1Y8/&quot;&gt;Viktor Orban ignored court orders requiring payouts of state funds.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For this one, we originally wrote: “We haven’t really seen it yet, though we’ve come close a bunch of times, and Musk loves tweeting that judges should have no power. But this will be one of the most alarming possible signs of a descent into authoritarianism. Given that every Republican in Congress seems to be enjoying a good long nap right now, the judicial branch is the only other center of power with the constitutional right to check Trump. If Trump decides to ignore them, that is a very scary sign that we are now completely outside the rule of law system.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since then, it’s unfortunately happened: &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/q8QcM&quot;&gt;the Trump administration went ahead and deported more than 200 Venezuelans despite a judge ordering them to halt the deportations&lt;/a&gt;. This is bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hyping up the fanboys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create people for your followers to hate.&lt;/strong&gt; Enemies at home! Enemies abroad! Your followers need to know that the woke deep-state transgender globalists, with all their fancy degrees, are colluding with the European Union to force everyone to get DEI surgery!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where have we seen this before?&lt;/em&gt; Russian propaganda looooooves talking trash about “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/putin-claims-real-war-being-waged-against-russia/a-65557289&quot;&gt;globalist elites&lt;/a&gt;.” And about “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/02/15/russia-first-convictions-under-lgbt-extremist-ruling&quot;&gt;extremist&lt;/a&gt;” LGBT activists. And about lots of other paranoid stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt; Hooboy. Do we really have to give you a link for this one?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage violence against the haters!&lt;/strong&gt; Physical, psychological, all kinds of violence will do. You just want your haters scared, and all the better if you don’t personally have to get your hands dirty doing it. Remember, trauma = good times!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where have we seen this before?&lt;/em&gt; During the Cultural Revolution in China, Mao whipped Red Guards into a frenzy, letting them terrorize people throughout the country, &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/nmg7i&quot;&gt;sometimes even beating them to death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt; Super fun-time guy Russ Vought, now in charge of the government’s budget and management office, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/10/who-is-russell-vought-trump-office-of-management-and-budget&quot;&gt;said in October 2024&lt;/a&gt; that “We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected . . . When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.” That said, we should be on the alert for increased physical violence against the administration’s “enemies.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use ambiguity as a sword and shield&lt;/strong&gt;. Your fanboys LOVE it when you say or do something fascist, and all the lame normies totally buy it when you tell them it was just a joke! Anyone who doesn’t think it’s a joke is trying to get you canceled! But actually you meant it anyway haha&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where have we seen this before?&lt;/em&gt; The precursor of this phenomenon is the dog whistle: using coded language to appeal to your followers while maintaining deniability. And the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/04/26/990274685/how-extremists-weaponize-irony-to-spread-hate&quot;&gt;alt-right in America&lt;/a&gt; has been known to use irony to attract new followers while maintaining deniability for many years now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt;  Both Steve Bannon and Elon Musk pretending that the very clear Nazi salutes they made, were, in fact, just a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2glydm3gmo&quot;&gt;wave&lt;/a&gt;” or a non-event hyped up in a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy48v1x4dv4o&quot;&gt;sooo tired&lt;/a&gt;” attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enforcing ideology through propaganda and censorship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a war on the objective truth. People under the Emperor have to repeat his lies, otherwise they’ll be considered disloyal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack the media and bring it under your control when you can&lt;/strong&gt;.This is a bigly important step. There’s a lot to admire in the Chinese Communist Party here, which understands the value in getting people to shut up. Some of its tried and true techniques, which we’re now seeing in the US, include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chinafile.com/library/nyrb-china-archive/china-anaconda-chandelier&quot;&gt;Make people afraid to publish on certain topics, resulting in individual and institutional self-censorship&lt;/a&gt;. In the US, world’s richest coward Jeff Bezos &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/oeLHP&quot;&gt;decided that his opinion columnists could no longer have opinions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/article/china-anti-journalist-and-fake-news-campaign-to-continue-in-2023&quot;&gt;Punish&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cjr.org/analysis/uighur-xinjiang.php&quot;&gt;limit&lt;/a&gt; media organizations that print what you don’t want them to and give preferential treatment to the ones that do. In the US, Trump kicked the Associated Press out of White House briefings for &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/uFOav&quot;&gt;refusing to use the frankly embarrassing term “Gulf of America”&lt;/a&gt; and offered up a briefing spot to &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/NolsV&quot;&gt;fact-lite scream factory Newsmax instead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/our-research/how-does-chinese-government-manage-social-media-case-weibo&quot;&gt;Gain effective control over private social media&lt;/a&gt;. In the US, this has allowed Elon to turn X into a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/3AUaP&quot;&gt;pro-Trump echo chamber&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/foreign-journalists-china-intimidation-survey&quot;&gt;Physically attack journalists&lt;/a&gt;. We haven’t seen the government (or government-hired thugs) do this yet, but we have seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/E0ipm&quot;&gt;individual nutjobs do it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/chinese-government-censors-ruling-lines-through-australian-books-20190222-p50zpn.html&quot;&gt;lists of banned words&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/hWgei&quot;&gt;topics&lt;/a&gt; to publishers – This hasn’t happened quite so explicitly yet. (Lots of self-censorship is already happening. We know this first hand because some of our employers have been doing this.) But we should be on the lookout for the government to start doing it directly..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/nJPX0&quot;&gt;Give outlets propaganda talking points to parrot&lt;/a&gt;. – Ditto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/dfsr6&quot;&gt;Harass journalists so much that they quit&lt;/a&gt;. – Ditto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/XDY3P&quot;&gt;Arrest and prosecute journalists&lt;/a&gt;. – Ditto. (The Cheeto-in-Chief has sure been making lots of threats though, so we fully expect them to test the waters at some point soon.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/geLtQ&quot;&gt;Shut down independent news outlets&lt;/a&gt;. – Ditto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extol and try to impose “traditional values.”&lt;/strong&gt; Remember when men were men and women weren’t . . . much of anything? And white people could walk around doing whatever they wanted without anyone making them feel even a tiny bit self-conscious about it? That was super awesome for everyone, as long as everyone was a white guy. Why don’t we do that again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where have we seen this before?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20250124084705/https://theconversation.com/kremlin-promotes-traditional-values-but-leaves-some-battles-to-the-governors-246396&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; has been casting itself as the defender of “traditional values”, to give just one of many examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt;  “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-trump-appointee-said-200100703.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJtANwvWqQFxqPojc_GzAMCmbiJKTlGTwiRVZg9et_VxDSznD_fH9bn75qRETAmSk1WLSmPY2Jl3jaMySnhnjpoXYNL0d_c9Tr_mvjnqS2noTXdNWKi6VTRyuoPDwlsFuKzkd2CbFKCuV2z-SVvzC10BA4oA_9KqTVTY1GQ-AZRH&quot;&gt;Competent white men&lt;/a&gt;” taking the places of people with actual expertise. Leaders claiming to protect women, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/donald-trump-women-protector-wisconsin-rally&quot;&gt;whether the women like it or not&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advance an anti-science, anti-expert agenda.&lt;/strong&gt; You know who can call out your bs? Anyone who deals with hard data and/or the laws of physics. It would probably be bad if all their “facts” got in the way of your bloviating. Better make sure that no one believes them, just in case they do manage to get the word out . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where have we seen this before?&lt;/em&gt; In 1950s China, citizens were urged to kill sparrows (among other creatures) en masse to prevent them from eating grain. But, uh, turns out sparrows were &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0306422018800259&quot;&gt;pretty important for keeping down the locust population&lt;/a&gt;, and while the sparrow thing wasn’t the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; reason for the famine that followed, it wasn’t &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the reason…&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/static/img/Kill_bird_and_insect.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Kill_bird_and_insect&quot; title=&quot;Kill_bird_and_insect&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chineseposters.net/themes/four-pests&quot;&gt;Image source&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=98472101&quot;&gt;Public Domain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt; RFK is a leading proponent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/Eqxeb&quot;&gt;killing chickens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/HCKcr&quot;&gt;also your kids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lie with confidence&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, yes, all politicians lie. But they don’t lie like YOU. You don’t care how obvious or pathetic your lies are. You’re not there to explain away a mistake or spin a gaffe. YOU ARE THERE TO INVENT YOUR OWN REALITY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where have we seen this before?&lt;/em&gt; This &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/05/a-list-of-hitlers-lies-compiled-by-the-office-of-war-information-in-1942.html&quot;&gt;1942 list of Hitler’s biggest lies&lt;/a&gt; contains some great examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/Tk8Ej&quot;&gt;All day&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/4NUXS&quot;&gt;every day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Suppressing dissent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, there’s censorship, but there’s also lots of other ways to keep people from organizing against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distract, distract, distract&lt;/strong&gt;. Real hard for all those whiny libs to band together if they’re all whining about something different. Do everything, so your haters can do nothing!  Flood the zone, baby!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where have we seen this before?&lt;/em&gt; There probably are examples of this elsewhere, but we don’t personally know of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt; Flooding the zone &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/KT9eR&quot;&gt;IS the key strategy of the second Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Fix” problems so they’ll shut up&lt;/strong&gt;. If the whiny libs DO manage to cause a ruckus, just tell them you’re fixing whatever it is they’re whining about. They’ll feel better and go away. Plus it’ll keep your pain-in-the-arse know-it-all bureaucrats busy with a bunch of bs paperwork. Problem solved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where we’ve seen this before:&lt;/em&gt; See above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/the-usaid-emergency-waivers-arent-working-from-ebola-to-aids/&quot;&gt;USAID waivers for Ebola and AIDS work, which were promised and which the Trump Administration insists exist but that people doing the work say are useless&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start dividing people up into groups so you can better surveil, harass, and restrict them&lt;/strong&gt;. How are you going to start hunting down all the “DEI” people if you don’t know where they are? Better get those details all written down somewhere so you can send in the goons when it’s time. Also, don’t forget to harass anyone that seems like they might be in the wrong group! (Someone look not-quite-white? Make them show their papers!) It’s important you keep them from getting too uppity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where we’ve seen this before:&lt;/em&gt; In the last decade, the Chinese government has put multiple ethnic groups (Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, among others) under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/video-photos/interactive/2019/05/02/china-how-mass-surveillance-works-xinjiang&quot;&gt;extreme surveillance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/anLsY&quot;&gt;extra-legal detention&lt;/a&gt;, including in &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/5sDFo&quot;&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt;. But a big part of this was making lots and lots of &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/sWsu5&quot;&gt;lists and databases&lt;/a&gt; to track everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/CeHxy&quot;&gt;Missouri wants to make lists of anyone who could potentially, maybe, possibly think about having an abortion: “Maintain a central registry of each expectant mother who is at risk for seeking an abortion of her unborn child.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something to watch out for: particular groups of people suddenly being denied passports or the right to travel (like how in China &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afr.com/world/asia/china-demands-schoolteachers-hand-in-their-passports-20241007-p5kggo&quot;&gt;school teachers have been asked to hand in their passports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack civil society&lt;/strong&gt;. Those a**holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where we’ve seen this before:&lt;/em&gt; Jailing peaceful protesters and artists, like the band &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/nIUpw&quot;&gt;Pussy Riot in Russia&lt;/a&gt;, or the activist &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/vLtqI&quot;&gt;“Feminist Five” in China&lt;/a&gt;. This also gives protesters criminal records, which can harm their future employment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt; During the George Floyd protests in 2020, the New York City police &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/UYKcV&quot;&gt;deprived protesters&lt;/a&gt; “of their first amendment rights through a ‘coordinated’ campaign of indiscriminate brutality and unlawful arrests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/static/img/georgia.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;georgia&quot; title=&quot;georgia&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Protesters in Georgia blasted by water canons while waving the EU flag.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manufacture (or exploit) a disaster.&lt;/strong&gt; This one’s an oldie but a goodie. People don’t complain as much when you restrict their rights right after some sort of catastrophe. But then you don’t have to give them those rights back! And you’ve taken away their right to even ask for them back! Classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where we’ve seen this before:&lt;/em&gt; “&lt;a href=&quot;https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-reichstag-fire&quot;&gt;On February 27, 1933, the German parliament (Reichstag) building burned down due to arson. The Nazi leadership and its German Nationalist coalition partners exploited the fire … They claimed that emergency legislation was needed … the resulting act “For the Protection of the People and State” abolished a number of constitutional protections and paved the way for Nazi dictatorship&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt; They’re starting small with a bunch of random “&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/FhSkx&quot;&gt;emergencies&lt;/a&gt;” but be on the lookout for something much bigger. Project 2025 has suggested that Trump invoke the Insurrection Act.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack your enemies with trumped-up (see what we did there?) or unrelated charges&lt;/strong&gt;. Is some loudmouth really pissing you off but technically hasn’t done anything illegal? No problem, find some other reason to arrest them! No way your beautiful conservative judges are going to stop you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where we’ve seen this before:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/I6imO&quot;&gt;In 2022, Kazakhstan labeled protesters as “terrorists” so it could use anti-terrorist laws against them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt; A Wisconsin judge was arrested &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/i00zW&quot;&gt;allegedly for helping an undocumented man avoid abduction by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents outside her courtroom&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; The merits of the case are almost beside the point–it’s clear the arrest was designed to intimidate other judges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send out Interpol notices to catch political opponents who have fled abroad&lt;/strong&gt;. See, there’s this “‘international police” organization that will arrest people for you. All you have to do is tell them that the people are very, very bad!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where we’ve seen this before:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://safeguarddefenders.com/en/blog/repeat-offender-chinas-violations-interpol-rules-continue-benin-and-thailand&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; uses Interpol notices against political dissidents, trying to get other countries to arrest and ship them back home. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/interpol-policing-success-failures-60-minutes/&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; does it, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will America join its new authoritarian friends in abusing Interpol notices? Probably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enacting state-sponsored violence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the part where things get truly ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International aggression, or acting like a mafia state&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where have we seen this before?&lt;/em&gt; Russia invading &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/ulkGM&quot;&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/0442Q&quot;&gt;Crimea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/KVAFC&quot;&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt; Trump is threatening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/CYz5Y&quot;&gt;annex Greenland&lt;/a&gt;, or take over the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/Bc6ZY&quot;&gt;Panama Canal&lt;/a&gt;, or make &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/rBZEM&quot;&gt;Canada the 51st state&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra-legal detentions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where have we seen this before?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/5sDFo&quot;&gt;Internment camps in Xinjiang&lt;/a&gt; (China).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt; One extra-legal option (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/trump-guantanamo-bay-migrants&quot;&gt;sending immigrants to Guantanamo&lt;/a&gt;) already happened. &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-deportations-gang-venezuela-0cf2c3a26d7f4bafa87ad6ca5a640313&quot;&gt;Immigrants have also been illegally sent to El Salvadorian jails&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2025/02/05/nx-s1-5287670/trump-el-salvador-americans-prison&quot;&gt;Donald Trump has entertained the idea of sending prisoners who are US citizens to El Salvador&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass prosecutions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where have we seen this before?&lt;/em&gt; In 2024, Hong Kong &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/i3a0I&quot;&gt;handed jail sentences to 45 people in a mass trial&lt;/a&gt;. Their crime? Trying to exercise their rights in Hong Kong’s electoral system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where have we seen this in the U.S.?&lt;/em&gt; Thankfully, nowhere yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use of military force against citizens&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where have we seen this before?&lt;/em&gt; In 1989, &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/6DhFp&quot;&gt;the Chinese Communist Party sent in troops to gun down student and worker protesters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt; We know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52886736&quot;&gt;Trump would have liked to send in the military against the George Floyd protestors in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. What happens now that so many of the previous guardrails have been dismantled?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use of (or tolerating) non-uniformed assailants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where have we seen this before?&lt;/em&gt; On July 21, 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/4867ea5aafbd45b78eb1747b8b84c04f&quot;&gt;protesters in Hong Kong were beaten to a pulp by men in white shirts&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s clear that those men in white shirts were just working on behalf of the government.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt; We’ve seen some vaguely related things (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/0LEro&quot;&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/ice-agents-detain-tufts-university-graduate-student&quot;&gt;ICE employees&lt;/a&gt; wearing masks when kidnapping someone), but this is not the same as the government literally hiring thugs to beat people up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killing political opponents.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where have we seen this before?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/vladimir-putin-personally-ordered-salisbury-poisoning-uk-believes-jonathan-allen/&quot;&gt;Putin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/STlj5&quot;&gt;loves&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/russia-kremlin-enemy-navalny-prigozhin-litvinenko-skripal-958c2ed6b8d60ecc4f64092fc1f9ceb5&quot;&gt;doing&lt;/a&gt; this, especially with poison. Saudi Arabia killed and &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/vkvmA&quot;&gt;dismembered journalist Jamal Khashoggi at an embassy in Turkey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are we seeing it in the US?&lt;/em&gt; Nowhere, we don’t think?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<title>How to Resist</title>
		<link href="/posts/resist/"/>
		<updated>2025-03-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>/posts/resist/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Get your mind right&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistance starts in the head. A lot of what you’re going to have to do starts with your thoughts. Humans don’t like to stand out from the crowd. Authoritarians know how to use this collective trait of ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solidarity starts in the head.&lt;/strong&gt; You need to switch your mindset from “how can I avoid getting in trouble?” to “If I don’t resist now, I will be next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be willing to stand out.&lt;/strong&gt; There’s no way you’re going to get through this flying under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/static/img/landmesser.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;August Landmesser&quot; title=&quot;August Landmesser&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He probably felt uncomfortable. He still didn&#39;t do it.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accept that this will be socially uncomfortable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Saying “no” to people is uncomfortable. Standing up for others can be uncomfortable. People do really stupid stuff because they don’t want to stand out from the crowd. Don’t let yourself be peer pressured into doing things you know are wrong. Ask yourself, “When I’m on my deathbed, will I be proud that I went along with this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if you do the socially uncomfortable regularly enough, you may encourage others to join you. Each voice of dissent matters. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/666989763/posts/pfbid02yyZLV85dht9UossVXSrj8Ydj7BXhyYbXxGf2ePnu343GvUCZx5ToqFGc22yJkFD9l/?mibextid=cr9u03&quot;&gt;1987 recreation&lt;/a&gt; of a Soviet performance art piece includes a scene in which actors individually ask, “What could I have done on my own?” More and more actors join in asking this question, until they are all marching and chanting together, powerfully demonstrating that a crowd is, in fact, made up of individuals who chose to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t assume that “Compromise” with the powers that be will protect you.&lt;/strong&gt;
This is especially true for this particular Cheeto-in-Chief. This is a guy who will change his mind depending on how his hair looks that day, and it doesn’t matter to him if you’ve previously helped him by “compromising.”&lt;br /&gt;
Look at all the comrades around Stalin. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://cameralabs.org/11680-sovetskij-fotoshop-kak-v-stalinskuyu-epokhu-izbavlyalis-ot-lyudej-i-perepisyvali-istoriyu&quot;&gt;virtually disappeared when they stopped being useful to him&lt;/a&gt;: they were physically eliminated, erased from photos, and, eventually, from history books. Nothing is forever. Sorry, mate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things may get really bad, including for you personally. Put on your big boy pants and be ready to stand firm. Accept there may be costs for your actions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is fundamentally about taking courage. If you stand out/stand up, you may get punished for doing so. There are different levels of scariness—you could be sidelined at your job, get fired, or even end up in jail. Let’s hope that none of these things happen—especially that last one—but time to start steeling yourself for the consequences of your righteous actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hold yourself accountable.&lt;/strong&gt; If you did something that made you feel you went against your values, write it down. Put it on a little sticky note and post it on your bathroom mirror or anywhere else you can see it. Don’t normalize this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t let anyone convince you you’re being hysterical.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ladies, you’ll already have lots of experience with this, given that people have been telling you to calm down since forever. For everyone else: you’re not crazy. This is bad. Repeat: I’m not crazy. This is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/static/img/Elon_Musk_gesture.gif&quot; alt=&quot;elon&quot; title=&quot;elon&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yep, he&#39;s doing the Hitler salute.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t let anyone convince you that America has always been like this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is genuinely different than anything that’s happened in our lifetimes. We know and agree that &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20250407092405/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/opinion/black-americans-trump-politics.html&quot;&gt;Black Americans have been dealing with a lot of this before&lt;/a&gt;. We need to make sure we don’t hurl ourselves back into the 1950s, or the 1860s, at record speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it walks like a duck . . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You don’t have to know someone’s intent to accurately describe their behavior. Guess what? You can NEVER know what’s in another person’s heart. You probably don’t even know what’s in your own. But you can look at someone’s history of statements and behavior and use that to contextualize what they’re doing today.&lt;br /&gt;
Traditional media: We’re looking at you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/static/img/bannon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bannon&quot; title=&quot;bannon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yep, he&#39;s doing the Hitler salute.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Believe people when they tell or show you who they are.&lt;/strong&gt; Many of the terrible things that Trump &amp;amp; Co have done were very explicitly part of their plans, people just didn’t want to believe them. Like the folks who worked for government agencies and voted for Trump because &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/GgRTn&quot;&gt;they didn’t think THEY would get fired&lt;/a&gt;. If these they’re telling you they’re going to do something that’s going to screw a lot of people, DO NOT ASSUME YOU ARE SAFE FROM GETTING SCREWED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t allow yourself to become numb or cynical.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It’s cool to be cynical. It’s self-protective to be numb. But both of these things also help autocrats by lowering our collective expectations and discouraging us from taking action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead, be the uncool, earnest person who believes in truth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As Timothy Snyder says, “To abandon facts is to abandon freedom.” Not to mention that facts are the basis for all the nice things we have, like electricity and germ theory. Once you give up on facts, you give up on any real tether to the world around you. You may find that your sincerity is infectious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put stock in fact-checked sources that have been fact-checked by, like, actual fact-checkers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT is not a source.&lt;/strong&gt; I swear to you, it doesn’t “know” anything. It’s a prediction machine. That’s why it ends up spewing out crazy, made-up nonsense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook is not a source.&lt;/strong&gt; Marion’s aunt’s cousin’s thoughts on things are not news. They’re just not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TikTok and Instagram are not a source.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if the people on them have perfectly contoured cheekbones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, some experts &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; on social media. Many of them have substacks now. This is not to say you can only read academic journals and media with a 150-year history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts are, generally, good, and you can use them to help you make sense of what’s happening.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
They’ve spent a lot of time learning stuff so you don’t have to. Someone who “did their own research” online is not an expert. But someone with a track record of serious scholarship or reporting on a subject can serve as someone to help you find your way through the morass. Follow trusted experts who can help synthesize events and help you see patterns amongst all the noise. We recommend M. Gessen as someone to follow – they have a lot of experience with authoritarianism and &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/49ExY&quot;&gt;write beautifully about it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, choose the lesser evil.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Nothing is perfect, y’all. Don’t fall for &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/EYhUZ&quot;&gt;both-sides-ism&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/zyABG&quot;&gt;what-about-ism&lt;/a&gt;. Just pick the less-bad candidate/option. The immediate goal is to stop a slide into fascism, not to make sure everyone can pass a purity test.&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, it sucks. But life isn’t fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistance can’t stay in your head. It has to translate into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Form (or reinforce) democracy-supporting and anti-authoritarian habits.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To the best of your ability, support the institutions fighting the good fight&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
What are ways you can do this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscribe to a news source that has shown some spine in recent weeks. WIRED, 404media, and ProPublica are all great examples of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donate money to an NGO that is working to stop the slide into facism in whatever capacity feels most urgent to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File or join a lawsuit against the administration if you have the chance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point out a lie when you spot it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speak out when institutions are being attacked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a list of all the things that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc7HmhrgTuQ&quot;&gt;“government” does for you&lt;/a&gt;, and speak out in defense of “government.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re on the inside, god bless. Stay strong. Take your shots where and when you can. We love you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the institutions that are still available to protect the ones under attack.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Go to a town hall. Vote in state and local elections. Consider running for office.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://5calls.org/&quot;&gt;Call&lt;/a&gt; you senator or representative. If you&#39;re not sure what to say, Dr. Pru Lee made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/50501/comments/1k1yvv7/a_call_to_action_by_dr_prue_lee/&quot;&gt;great list of things to ask for&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call things what they are.&lt;/strong&gt; A Hitler salute is a Hitler salute, not a “controversial gesture.”  A coup is a coup, not a “government shakeup.” Attacking DEI is a means of creating a neo-apartheid. Removing consumer protections is a means to transfer wealth from average Americans to billionaires.&lt;br /&gt;
Call things what they are. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/thoc.bsky.social/post/3lins575xhc24&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Especially if nobody else is doing so.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get off your bum and go outside…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Doomscrolling makes you feel bad. Going outside and protesting makes you feel good. Posting righteous memes isn’t going to cut it. You gotta be with other people, in real life, in a physical space. Maybe you know them already. Maybe you don’t. Whatever. Do a march. Sing a song. Be human together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;… or find your inside strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We know we just said going outside and protesting makes people feel good, but some of y’all may not be able to do that. Maybe you can’t walk long distances. Maybe you just really hate crowds. That’s okay. Find a way to contribute to the resistance that works for you. Create some art. Write your thoughts down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t waste your time arguing with people who are more or less on the right side.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, it is annoying when your so-called allies disagree with you on certain aspects of foreign policy, or don’t subscribe to all the causes you champion at home. But if they are anti-Trump, anti-Musk, and anti-authoritarian, then let it go. There is a bigger problem that we all need to address together—and if we don’t address it, you won’t even have the option to yell at each other in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seriously: this also applies to former Trump voters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Anyone who no longer supports Trump is your ally now. We know you want to tell those government employees who voted for Trump and then got fired that they had it coming. But every second you spend fighting and belittling people who were wrong about something is a second you’re not focusing on the real target. Let it go. Or don’t. We don’t care if you actually “forgive people” who voted for Trump. You can hate them in your heart forever. Just don’t waste everyone’s time complaining about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are a white guy, time to step up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Trust me, this totally sucks for everyone involved. We would love it if you weren’t taken more seriously than we are just because you are a white dude. You probably don’t want this responsibility just because you are a white dude. But, alas, the fact that you’re a white dude is what’s going to make them listen to you, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:syoheyke4ggfo6t75qhvdih3/post/3linkjrvt622e&quot;&gt;please speak up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being kind is a superpower, and one they don’t have.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So much of this comes down to: why be a dick to random people if you don’t have to? Why? You could just NOT be a dick. Think about it.&lt;br /&gt;
If you really need to be unkind to someone, punch up to someone who really deserves it. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/yaATQ&quot;&gt;queen Natasha Rothwell&lt;/a&gt; tweets “You are trash” at Donald Trump every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public art/performance is great for calling out the craziest stuff they do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes, you just need a simple grand gesture to make the point much clearer than a bunch of words ever could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/static/img/heil-tesla.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;heiltesla&quot; title=&quot;heiltesla&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Performance art at the Tesla factory in Brandenburg, Germany&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take it upon yourself to remove signs of hate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Even if it’s not your job. Little bits of graffiti, or signs and stickers, that promote hate can slowly accrete and normalize that hate. Help fight the tide of normalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It doesn’t matter if they’re breaking the law, you still shouldn’t break the law.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As Timothy Snyder says, “Remember professional ethics.” Do your job with integrity and within the bounds of the law, even if they’re telling you not to. If they’ve made it impossible for you to do that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/E7ZhE&quot;&gt;resign in a blaze of glory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/static/img/judges.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;judges&quot; title=&quot;judges&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure your information and don’t put everything about yourself online.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Assume that what you type into any online device could be read by the government if they really wanted to read it. Someone could use this information to blackmail or bully you. So, take some basic steps to secure your devices and use encrypted communication platforms–not a perfect solution, but a very good first step. Check for malware. Be judicious in what you say about your personal life online. (Have conversations in person!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips and resources that can help you make better choices online:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a trusted VPN. Something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tunnelbear.com/)&quot;&gt;TunnelBear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://airvpn.org/&quot;&gt;AirVPN&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mullvad.net/&quot;&gt;Mullvad&lt;/a&gt;. Check back occasionally because sometimes trusted VPNs get bought up by untrustworthy actors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the Signal encrypted messaging app. We know Signal has been in the news a lot lately as a platform you should not use to share classified information. That’s totally true—if you’re a U.S. official please don’t discuss your war plans on Signal—but in terms of regular communication, it’s still the best we have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypt your email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these can perfectly secure your information. It’s like locking your door at home instead of leaving it wide open when you leave the house. People can still break into your home if they make a bit of an effort. But you’re not letting others freely wander in and take whatever they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find alternatives to the big tech and corporate giants.&lt;/strong&gt; They already have too much money and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you see something interesting or important online—particularly government information—archive it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Two good archiving resources are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/&quot;&gt;Archive.is&lt;/a&gt;. This is a key technique our friends in authoritarian countries have been using for a long time. We’re unfortunately now in the position of assuming the US government, too, will take down or hide their own information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Organize!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They want to divide and conquer. You want to do the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link up with similarly-minded people internationally.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There’s a lot to learn from our comrades in Russia and China. Autotranslate is pretty rad. There are also lots of dissidents exiled in the U.S. Talk to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also build community domestically by talking with people in other generations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Many of them have experience fighting overbearing government policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study and copy things that work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You’re not the first to fight authoritarians, and you won’t be the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try to bring others on board&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Give them the courage to join up by leading by example and showing what’s possible. Convince your friends to come to a protest with you, or phone bank, or door-knock, or . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But don’t push people to do things they’re not comfortable with, especially if you’re not willing to do those things yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you’re encouraging others to take risks, make sure they have had time to reflect on those risks and genuinely buy in. Don’t tell people what to do if you have no skin in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The darker things get, the more important it will be to signal to each other that opposition and resistance still exists.&lt;/strong&gt; Authoritarians want to convince you you are on your own with your thoughts. They want to make you feel alone and isolated while everyone else is out there celebrating the awesome new order. To stay in power, they need people to believe there is nothing they can do to challenge the regime. What better way than to convince you you’re on your own? Signs of resistance in public places break through this attempt to lock us into our own heads. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20250307064516/https://time.com/6238050/china-protests-censorship-urumqi-a4/&quot;&gt;That’s why&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20240817132012/https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/tiananmen-square-massacre-hong-kong-lion-rock-06032024142306.html&quot;&gt;movements around the world&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210427080330/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-24/thai-protests-rubber-duckies-dinosaurs-three-finger-salute/12911494&quot;&gt;use them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Make their lives harder&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They want to get you in line. Your job is to make their job harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask questions.&lt;/strong&gt;
If somebody asks you to do something, ask them why. Make them explain themselves. Make them self-conscious about what it is they’re asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always have them put concrete instructions in writing.&lt;/strong&gt;
If they ask you to censor yourself, make sure they go on the record about it. If they tell you to “tone down your criticism of the administration,” ask them to send you in an email what exactly you can’t write or say anymore. Ask them to be precise. If your boss asks you to remove certain words from your company website, ask them for exact instructions on what needs to go. Tell them that vagueness encourages people to excessively censor themselves, and surely, we all want to avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speak out for groups of people under attack, even if you aren’t personally affected.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Once they start stripping rights away from some, they can easily strip away rights from all. The famous quote from a Lutheran pastor who lived in Germany under the Nazi regime is famous for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;
“First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not obey in advance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It’s not your job to figure out what they want and give it to them before they demand it. In fact, it’s your job to do the opposite: keep on doing what you know is right until there’s absolutely no other option. There will be times when you may have no choice but to obey. Until then, keep on being your disobedient self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/static/img/HKMTR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;do not obey in advance&quot; title=&quot;do not obey in advance&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;During the 2019 Hong Kong protests, Timothy Snyder&#39;s words from &#39;On Tyranny&#39; found resonance with Hong Kongers and were turned into &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/DRPR2&quot;&gt;protest art&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t forget, you may have to do some genuinely scary stuff. Sorry about that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
They are absolutely going to try and scare you, and they may hurt you, because they really and truly don’t care about you, people generally, or the idea of democracy. You may get arrested. You may get beaten up. You may get even worse than that. This is not a risk you will have to face every day, but it is a risk you need to be ready to face. As Timothy Snyder says, “If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die under tyranny.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Crisis preparation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully most of you won’t need this, but especially if you are an active dissenter, you should prepare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make an escape plan. Don’t become the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog&quot;&gt;boiled frog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You may not need to use it, but it is easier to operationalize it if it’s already ready. Make sure you and your family have passports. Think about where you might go and know the visa policies for Americans in those places. Figure out who you can really trust IRL so you can call them when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set an emergency communications protocol up in advance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Have a codeword ready to send out to trusted contacts so they know you’re in trouble. You may only have a few seconds to do this before they take your phone away.&lt;br /&gt;
On the flip side, have a codeword to communicate that you are speaking under duress and/or that your conversation is being monitored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know how to get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://diversity.williams.edu/davis-center/online-resources/know-your-rights-protests-laws-law-enforcement-and-you/national-lawyers-guild-protest-resources/&quot;&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt; quickly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispose of any incriminating materials&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Regularly check your devices for photos or documents that could incriminate you or your colleagues and friends. In addition to keeping your electronic devices secure, make sure that your home and office are similarly clean in case they are searched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re going into a risky situation, including just participating in protest or crossing a border:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leave concrete instructions with trusted contacts.&lt;/strong&gt; They’ll need to know who you want notified and what else they should do to help you if you get detained. Will you need urgent access to medication? Is there anyone depending on you at home? How loudly do you want people to advocate for you (is it better if they go to the press, or negotiate behind the scenes)? Who should they contact on your behalf (a human rights’ group, your lawyer, your family)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring essential items in case you are detained&lt;/strong&gt;. Have a small bag packed that contains a toothbrush, spare glasses or contact lenses, spare underwear, and medication. Write down numbers on a piece of paper in case your phone gets taken. Don’t wear shoes with laces. Don’t bring sharp objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set up location sharing.&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure to use it when you sense anything is wrong–share your location with a trusted contact who is in a different location, so they know where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<title>How to Take Care of Yourself</title>
		<link href="/posts/care/"/>
		<updated>2025-03-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>/posts/care/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We stole a bunch of these from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@itsjenniferwalter/post/DFIu3Q2q-5P?hl=en&quot;&gt;Jennifer Walter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get offline and go outside.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
See people IRL. You need human contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit what you’re going to track.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Pick just a few issues and focus on those. You can’t follow everything, and that’s OK. Allow yourself to rely on others who are tracking different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit how much news you consume.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Enforce times when you’re not thinking of current events or checking the news. If you catch yourself thinking of all the bad things happening while on a mental break, tell your brain to stop. This gets easier the more you practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let yourself respond slowly to some events&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes you need space to think and internalize things. Don’t let them freak you out with new awful news every 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IT’S OK TO BE HAPPY AND ENJOY YOURSELF SOMETIMES. REALLY.&lt;/strong&gt; Making yourself a martyr to the cause doesn’t help anyone. There are plenty of things to enjoy even when the whole world is going down the drain. Each sunset is crazy beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes somebody else feel better doesn’t have to make you feel better.&lt;/strong&gt; Everybody needs to figure out ways that help them take care of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check in on your friends and family and see how they’re doing.&lt;/strong&gt; We all need to be reminded someone else is looking out for us.&lt;/p&gt;
