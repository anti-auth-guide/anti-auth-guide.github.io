  <h1>Why This Site Exists</h1>
  <p>We are a group of people who have spent much of their professional lives monitoring what’s going on in countries with authoritarian governments. We believe we can learn from other places to understand what is happening now in the US.</p>
<p>Why are we doing this? Because it sucks living under a corrupt, authoritarian governmental system in which rule of law no longer functionally exists–and we’re really worried the United States is on the brink of entrenching such a system. Part of the problem is that so many people seem to think that institutions, rules, and norms maintain themselves. They don’t. As Carlos Cortés, who left Venezuela for the United States, <a href="https://archive.is/GfLfJ">told the Washington Post</a>: “You don’t wake up one day and suddenly there’s no democracy,” he said. “We had elections, we had institutions, we had laws. … And then, little by little, everything changed.”</p>
<p>(We know there are people out there who think that America has always been fascist, that it’s just the same as all other evil global empires, and that what’s happening right now is simply exposing these facts to light. Sweet, innocent darlings. America is effed up, for sure, and it’s done a lot of horrific things, both at home and abroad. But maybe spend a little time talking to people who risked their lives fleeing an actual authoritarian country in order to get to the United States, yeah? Also, if it’s so terrible . . . why not just give Russia a try? You’re gonna love it!)</p>
<p>ANYWAYS, because it’s no fun living under a corrupt, authoritarian governmental system in which rule of law no longer functionally exists, we would like to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide some ways to think about what is happening right now in the United States by looking at patterns of government behavior we’ve seen elsewhere.</li>
<li>Offer some practical advice on how to resist when possible.</li>
<li>Urge you to take care of yourself and your community so you can better continue to fight.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because we’re just highly average basic bitches with very few original thoughts of our own, much of what we’ve collected here was originally said by much smarter people elsewhere. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhZxrogyToZsr4C9bgibkZFpVtrahKASA">Timothy Snyder</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@itsjenniferwalter/post/DFIu3Q2q-5P?hl=en">Jennifer Walter</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/javiercorrales.bsky.social/post/3lic77bysjk23">Javier Corrales</a>, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:rw2kfkoa7dvxmip5rm4nay7x/post/3liffl7pni22h">Christina Pagel</a>, among many others, inspired lots of the material on this site. We’ve tried to cite the original sources whenever we could. We also want to highlight the people out there doing the lord’s work in terms of aggregating information. For example, Danielle Harlow has begun <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/danielleharlow/viz/UnitedStatesDisappearedTracker/Map">tracking people</a> that ICE has kidnapped, deported, or otherwise illegally detained.</p>
<p>We don’t intend to update this site with any regularity. If you find anything of use here, please take it and do whatever you like with it.</p>
<p><em>-The authors, May 1, 2025</em></p>
<br />
<p><em>A final note about the term “fascism”:</em></p>
<p>We’ve tried to avoid using this term wantonly on this site. We’re frankly not fascism experts and didn’t have the time to get PhDs before this website went live. Also, bickering over labels often allows people to avoid actually reckoning with the truly bad stuff that is going down. Instead, we’re listing below some characteristics we think could describe a fascist regime. You can decide for yourself if you think that the label applies. It’s like a personality quiz! Fun!</p>
<p>Your government might be fascist if it . . .<br>
. . . develops a <a href="https://boingboing.net/2025/04/09/trumps-new-loyalty-test-golden-trump-bust-lapel-pins.html">cult of personality</a> around the leader<br>
. . . vigorously and violently suppresses political opposition<br>
. . . demonizes and dehumanizes enemies<br>
. . . relies on nostalgia and/or historical grievances as a rallying cry</p>
